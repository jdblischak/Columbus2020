### PJ Van Camp

When asking others for help with our R code, it's important to provide them with
a Reproducible Example (ReprEx). This is the minimal data and code you need to
recreate an issue. Using the 'reprex' and 'datapasta' package, this session will
teach you how to create one. If you're the expert helping someone else, it's
equally important you learn to structure your answer and provide not only a
solution but also understanding. A few tips will be provided for them as well.
