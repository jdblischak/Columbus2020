### Michael Sovic

Scientific and data literacies are arguably important characteristics of any
citizenry, as they can underlie everything from personal lifestyle choices to
the shaping of public policy. However, levels of such literacies vary with
regards to conceptual knowledge and also the process by which scientific and
quantitative understandings are constructed. Further, clearly communicating
scientific information can be difficult even when the audience consists of
domain experts, and so is especially challenging when the information is
targeted to those outside scientific and data-driven communities. The importance
of such literacy and effective communication has been apparent in issues ranging
from vaccines to climate, but was highlighted again with the circulation of
covid-19. Early in the pandemic, instances of miscommunications,
misunderstandings, and misinformation led to several calls for expanded efforts
by scientists to better engage with the public. As an attempt at one such
effort, I began creating short videos that use scientific issues in the news as
a springboard to talk about relevant data and concepts, and to also discuss the
nature of scientific information and the process by which scientific
understandings are built. In this talk, Iâ€™ll give examples of how R has provided
me a valuable platform for creating visualizations to help communicate difficult
concepts such as exponential growth, multiple testing effects, and reporting
biases, to individuals outside of science.
