In 2018, [Eye on Ohio](https://eyeonohio.com/) was one of just two U.S. outlets
selected for a grant by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting to investigate
property records.


A team of five people worked on this project for ten months, gathering,
analyzing, and verifying millions of parcels. After interviewing dozens of
people affected, writing approximately 700 lines of code to recalculate property
values, and verifying figures with local officials, Eye on Ohio was able to put
a price tag on a problem that affects communities in Ohio as well as most other
states.


[How Much are you Overpaying in Property Tax?](https://eyeonohio.com/property-tax-loophole/)


This project is based off of the simple idea that we can gain great insights by
combining different property data sets. Ohio keeps great records, but
unfortunately they are very county-centric. In other words, records tend to be
in 88 different places! Which makes things difficult to say the least.


For the first story in this series, we looked at how entity sales affect
property tax rates in Ohio. We know this has been going on for a while, but no
one had ever actually quantified the damage. We know that if some people
underpay their taxes, that means others overpay. But what does that actually
COST our readers? Thatâ€™s what we wanted to laser focus on.


For example, in Athens County, an apartment complex had been on the books for
approximately $13.8 million. But then a mortgage appraisal of the property found
it to be worth almost $49 million! However since the transaction was technically
only a sale of the business, and not the building, the buyer only paid to have
the name of the business changed. Total due to the county: 50 cents.


The story was picked up by 36 different news outlets, reaching an estimated half
million people.


After local coverage, a bipartisan group of lawmakers addressed the issue in a
new bill, and the Ohio Supreme Court issued an opinion that makes structuring
such deals much harder.


The Cincinnati Society of Professional Journalists named it the Best Government
News Story at their 2020 awards. I thought this would be a great way to show
what R can do. And we published all our work on our website so others can learn
from us.
