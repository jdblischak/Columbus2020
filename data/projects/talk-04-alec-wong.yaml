### Alec Wong

Several social media communities have converged on intra-word randomized mixed
casing as the accepted method of conveying sarcasm or mockery in printed text.
The {sarcasm} package fills a critical gap in the R package ecosystem by making
this mode of expression available for use in R programming, and thereby
reporting and other important documentation.


Actually, {sarcasm} is a goofy exploration which began with an attempt to
produce said intra-word randomized mixed casing in a functional fashion, and
evolved into a small exploration of error handling functions. Replicating this
behavior in Python served as additional exercise in Python programming, module
creation, and the use of the {reticulate} package. The minimal dependencies and
code also make it a good demonstration of R package infrastructure.


R packages are an excellent way to practice writing reproducible code, to test
new techniques, and share your work -- even if the purpose is silly.
