### Erika Rasnick

Relationships between place-based information and health outcomes are a common
area of interest in medical and public health research. This talk will describe
a set of publicly available tools and pipelines developed using R for
transforming a residential mailing address to geographic coordinates and
assigning a variety of place-based data (termed 'geomarkers'). DeGAUSS, an
offline container-based software powered by R, can be used for geocoding and
estimating exposure to greenspace, distance to nearest roadway (a marker of air
pollution exposure), access to medical care measured by drive time, and
community-level poverty and deprivation, while protecting private health
information. Further, we have developed a set of R packages that can be used for
spatiotemporal geomarker assessment, including weather data and model-based
estimation of traffic-related air pollution exposure.
