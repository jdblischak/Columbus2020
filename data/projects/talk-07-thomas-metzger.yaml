### Thomas Metzger

Linear models with categorical predictors are one of the most widely used
statistical methods across a variety of scientific fields. However, common
simplistic assumptions associated with such linear models may lead to model
misspecification and ignore key relationships within the data. With the new R
package 'slgf', I implement a model selection approach which utilizes Bayesian
statistics to detect structures that would otherwise be disregarded by usual
approaches. This R package allows the user to specify a set of candidate models,
model structures, and Bayesian priors to quantify the posterior probability of
each specified model. I illustrate this method and the usage of slgf through
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and
unreplicated two-way layouts using real data sets, although slgf is broadly
applicable to the class of linear models that includes categorical predictors.
