### Cole Brokamp

Transferring an R project from one computing environment to another is a common
task, including moving a local R project to a high performance computer, sending
a project to a collaborator (including your future self), deploying a Shiny
application, deploying R code to a continuous integration server, or creating a
research compendium to ensure the reproducibility of your project. This process
requires the capture and deployment of specific versions of R packages, their
system dependencies, and R itself. In this talk, I will give an overview of thee
different mechanisms for accomplishing this task: (1) using a static package
repository (e.g., MRAN snapshots), (2) using helper packages (e.g., {dep},
{renv}, {sysreqs}), and (3) using containers (e.g. Docker, Singularity). The
desired balance between reproducibility and complexity for a specific project
should direct what might be the best method. I will discuss these tradeoffs and
how these three mechanisms can work separately and together to achieve true
computational mobility.
