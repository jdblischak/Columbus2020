### Joshua Lambert

During the process of building a regression model, data scientists are sometimes
tasked with assessing the effects of one or more variables of interest. With an
additive regression model, effects (eg. treatment) are assumed to equal across
all possible subgroups(eg. sex, race, age). This assumption is typically not
true, and in the era of personalized medicine we must begin to demand more
insight from our regression models. The package rFSA (Lambert, 2018), implements
an algorithm meant to explore subgroup specific effects in large datasets by
identifying 2 and 3 way interactions to add to multivariable regression models.
This package supports the optimization of multiple criteria, and different
modeling strategies. This talk will give a short introduction to rFSA and how it
can be applied to regression models in R. A strategy for interaction
visualization will also be discussed.
